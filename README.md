# Documentation for RHoMIS 2.0

Skeleton for RHoMIS 2.0 documentation built using sphinx. 

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make the documentation with the command `make html`. The documentation can then be found in the `_build` directory. To view the documentation in your browser, open the file `_build/html/index.html` in your browser. 

Feel free to add to or change any of the documentation. If you would like to add any extra sections, add a file in the `source` directory, then be sure to reference it in the toctree (found in the `index.rst` file). Click [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html) for further information on using sphinx. The documentation in the `source` folder is written using restructured text. Click [here](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) for information on using restructured text.

If you have any issues, I may have left out a dependency or a step, please let me know and we will fix as soon as possible!
