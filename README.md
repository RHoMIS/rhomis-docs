# Documentation for RHoMIS 2.0

Skeleton for RHoMIS 2.0 documentation built using sphinx. 

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make the documentation with the command `make html`. The documentation can then be found in the `_build` directory. To view the documentation in your browser, open the file `_build/html/index.html` in your browser. 

If you have any issues, I may have left out a dependency or a step, please let me know and we will fix as soon as possible!
