What is RHoMIS
--------------------------------------------
The Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) has been
widely used since 2015. RHoMIS is a suite of tools designed to
collect harmonised data on smallholder farmers. Since 2020, the 
RHoMIS team have been working on RHoMIS 2.0, an improved version of
the RHoMIS system. Automation of processes is the focus of 
RHoMIS 2.0. The improved tool consists of a set of interoperable tools 
used to simplify survey design, data management, and data processing. 

It consists of the following main components:

#. **Survey module library**: A library of standard survey modules on key topics related to smallholder agriculture.
#. **Survey builder interface**: A graphical user interface which helps users design surveys by selecting from the module library.
#. **Data collection and management software**: For data collection we use the `ODK Collect  <https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro/>`_ application. For data management, we use the `ODK Central <https://docs.getodk.org/central-intro/>`_ application.
#. **Automated data processing**: An R-package that makes it easier to process raw data and calculate key indicators
#. **Dashboard**: A dashboard-style application which can be used to access processed datasets
