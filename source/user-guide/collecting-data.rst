Collecting Data
=======================================

Once you have built your survey, you are ready to start 
collecting data.

If you have just build a survey builder, there will be
a button to redirect you back to the "RHoMIS App". 

If you are working from the RHoMIS homepage, select "Manage Existing Projects", 
select your project, select your form, and under options select "collect data".

Filling in Data
#######################################

Draft Forms
--------------------------------------

It is useful to fill in data on draft forms to see
how the survey flows. When you arrive
at "Collect Data" page, you can scan the QR code in the 
ODK collect app and start collecting data. 

.. warning::
    
    Data collected when your form is 
    in "draft mode" will not be kept.
    If you plan to collect data which 
    you hope to keep, finalize your form.

    Don't worry, you can always change 
    the form after it is finalized
    by creating a new draft. 

Finalized Forms
--------------------------------------

For finalized forms, you will be collecting
real data. Simply go to the "Collect Data" 
page, as shown above.
Scan the QR code in the ODK collect app and
start collecting data.
