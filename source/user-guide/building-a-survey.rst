Building a Survey
===========================

The design of a survey takes place in 4 main stages:

1. **Initialisation**: Name your project/questionnaire
2. **Build**: Build a survey by selecting predefined modules
3. **Localisation**: Selecting choices which are appropriate for the location where you will conduct your survey
4. **Review**: Work with and modify your survey, either by testing it with people or by generating synthetic data



1. Initialising your Project
#######################################

When you visit the survey builder, you will see a form
which looks like the one below. Here you will enter 
information on the questionnaire you are building. You
will first need to select a project name, a form name, 
and enter some metadata about how you intend to use 
the survey. Once you have finished entering the metadata,
press "Save and Continue".

.. admonition:: Projects and Forms

    Projects and forms are a useful way to 
    organise your questionnaires. 

    - **Projects** can contain many forms. It can be helpful to store related forms within a project. 
    - **Forms** are the questionnaires themselves. 



.. sidebar:: Modules

    Core modules are used in most RHoMIS survey, they are essential
    for calculating key indicators such as household size, income, 
    food security, and dietary diversity. 

    Additional modules are available to add to the questionnaire. They 
    include more specific questions on specialist topics. See the 
    :download:`RHoMIS Module Booklet <../files/rhomis_modules_booklet.pdf>`
    for more information

2. Designing Your Questionnaire
#######################################


During the questionnaire design, you can select from a 
set of premade modules. Core modules are preselected for 
you. Available modules can be added by dragging from 
"available modules" (on the right), into "selected modules"
on the left.

A few things to keep in mind when building a survey:

- Keep as many core modules as possible. This will ensure you can calculate core indicators
- Try to keep the survey short, this will be less troublesome for the respondent and increase the likelihood of reliable answers
- Try to look at the modules in more detail, and see what would be a sensible order to ask the questions.

.. note::
    It can take a while for the survey to build and save!

3. Editing Your Questionnaire
#######################################

.. warning::
    Once your form it is built it will be saved as a draft.
    This allows you to collect mock data, and see what that 
    data will look like. 

    Once you are happy with your form you can finalise it.
    Finalising a form locks it in place, but will also delete
    draft entries.
