Quickstart Guide
===========================================

This guide is designed to quickly get you started with RHoMIS 2.0. Please note, this is a work in progress. The guide
reflects where we currently are with RHoMIS 2.0, we are continously improving the system and will try to
update the documentation regularly. For now, we are using this guide to give all of the necessary information for people participating in the monthly
RHoMIS 2.0 meetings.
